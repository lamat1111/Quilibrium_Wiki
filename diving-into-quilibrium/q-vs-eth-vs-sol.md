# Q vs ETH vs SOL

Quilibrium is a novel decentralized system that differs from traditional blockchains in both architecture and performance. While not technically a blockchain, it can be analyzed in parallel with Ethereum 2.0 and Solana to provide context on its capabilities. Below is a breakdown of their respective specifications, offering insight into how Quilibrium fits within the broader landscape of decentralized computing.

### **Quilibrium: Raw Specifications**

* **Clock Speed (per core):** 54M OTs/s (\~54MHz)
* **CPU:** SMP Multicore (\~10^98 cores maximum), Garbled Circuits
* **RAM:** \~19kB Global, 1GB per core shard
* **HDD:** RAID6-like, max capacity of 1.8765 \* 10^107B

Quilibrium’s architecture relies on sharded data storage and computation, designed to ensure privacy and security while maintaining high performance. It utilizes garbled circuits, a cryptographic technique that allows secure multi-party computation (MPC), which enhances security without exposing sensitive data. The extensive potential core count suggests a system built for parallelized, distributed workloads.

### **Ethereum 2.0: Raw Specifications**

* **Clock Speed:** 30Mgas/4/12s (\~650kHz)
* **CPU:** Single instruction, stack-based, EVM bytecode, Turing Complete
* **RAM:** Requires full transaction history (\~1TB)
* **HDD:** 6 \* 4096 \* 32B sectors, 18-day in-network retention (\~100GB)

Ethereum 2.0 aims to improve upon Ethereum’s previous inefficiencies by implementing proof-of-stake and sharding. However, it still relies on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is stack-based and processes instructions sequentially. This structure, while flexible and widely adopted, can be less optimized for high-speed execution compared to parallel architectures.

### **Solana: Raw Specifications**

* **Clock Speed:** 48M CU/450ms (\~106MHz)
* **CPU:** Single instruction, event-based, eBPF, Turing Complete
* **RAM:** Requires pruned history (\~100GB)

Solana’s primary advantage is its high throughput, achieved via its Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism. It leverages an event-driven model with eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter), which allows for more efficient execution of smart contracts compared to traditional stack-based virtual machines. Solana’s clock speed is significantly higher than Ethereum’s, optimizing it for fast and frequent transaction processing.

### **Key Observations and Comparisons**

#### **Clock Speed & Computational Power:**

* Quilibrium operates at \~54MHz per core, while Solana’s equivalent computation unit runs at \~106MHz. However, Quilibrium’s SMP Multicore design (scaling up to \~10^98 cores) suggests a fundamentally different approach, where parallelism is a core strength rather than raw per-core speed.
* Ethereum 2.0, at \~650kHz, runs significantly slower than both Quilibrium and Solana, primarily due to its reliance on the EVM and the need for full transaction history validation.

#### **CPU & Execution Model:**

* Ethereum 2.0 uses a stack-based execution model, which limits efficiency in complex computations.
* Solana’s event-driven approach via eBPF improves upon this, allowing for optimized execution.
* Quilibrium’s use of garbled circuits and SMP Multicore suggests a focus on secure, high-performance computing that scales across an extensive number of cores.

#### **Storage & Data Management:**

* Ethereum 2.0 requires full history storage (\~1TB), leading to long-term scaling concerns.
* Solana prunes history aggressively (\~100GB), improving efficiency but potentially limiting on-chain data availability.
* Quilibrium’s RAID6-like storage mechanism with an astronomical theoretical capacity (1.8765 \* 10^107B) indicates a system optimized for distributed data redundancy and high availability.

### **Conclusion**

While Ethereum 2.0 and Solana are both established blockchain systems, Quilibrium presents a fundamentally different model centered around parallel computation, privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, and highly scalable architecture.&#x20;

Rather than focusing on linear improvements in execution speed or transaction throughput, it introduces a design paradigm that prioritizes distributed, secure, and efficient multi-party computation. These distinctions make it an interesting alternative for applications requiring both privacy and high computational efficiency.
