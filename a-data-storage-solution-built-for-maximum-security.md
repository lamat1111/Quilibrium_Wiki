# A data storage solution built for maximum security

Cybercrime is growing at an alarming rate. Over the past few decades, the cost and frequency of cyberattacks have skyrocketed, making secure data storage solutions more crucial than ever.

Modern systems are often plagued by overly complex architectures. This complexity weakens their overall security, leaving them more vulnerable to data breaches and exploitation.

**Complex systems come with significant security risks:**

* **Increased attack surface:**\
  More complex systems often have a larger "attack surface," meaning more potential entry points for hackers to target.
* **Patching difficulties:**\
  Keeping all parts of a complex system updated with the latest security patches can be challenging, leaving vulnerabilities open for exploitation.
* **Harder to monitor:**\
  With many interconnected components, effectively monitoring and managing security across the entire system becomes difficult, allowing issues to go unnoticed.
* **Poor visibility:**\
  The sheer complexity can make it hard to understand how different parts of the system interact, hindering the ability to identify security gaps.
* **Multiple-layer legacy systems:**\
  Integrating outdated systems with newer technology can create a complex, layered network with inconsistent security protocols, making it easier to breach.
* **Overlapping security tools:**\
  Using too many security products from various vendors can lead to complex configurations and potential conflicts, reducing overall effectiveness.

### Mitigating Complexity-Driven Risks

To address these challenges, it’s essential to simplify system architecture by reducing unnecessary components, streamlining operations, and enhancing security.

* **Encryption:**\
  Encrypt all information using industry-standard encryption methods. This includes data at rest and data in motion. Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the proper decryption key.
* **Decentralize on a Private MPC Network:**\
  Decentralized private networks using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) enhance security and privacy in data management by distributing data across private shards on multiple nodes.

### Quilibrium: The Solution

Quilibrium is designed to host a complex global internet infrastructure without falling prey to the weaknesses of traditional systems. Its innovative “uncomplex” design is a decentralized, cryptographically secure, and private sharded network built to withstand the ever-evolving threats posed by cybercrime.

By combining simplicity, encryption, privacy, and decentralization into an all-in-one solution, Quilibrium redefines secure data storage for organizations and institutions. Applications built on Quilibrium’s network can also thrive from the security and interoperability enhancements it provides.
