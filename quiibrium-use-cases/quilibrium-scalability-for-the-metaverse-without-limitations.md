# Quilibrium: scalability for the metaverse without limitations

### Network Infrastructure Requirements

To support the metaverse, network infrastructure must be capable of handling high throughput, low latency, and high reliability. This includes the need for a significant increase in computational efficiency from today's standards.&#x20;

Current internet infrastructure, largely built for static web pages and streaming, struggles with the real-time, interactive demands of a fully immersive virtual world. For example, the metaverse requires not just data delivery but also rapid synchronization of user actions across vast distances, necessitating advancements in edge computing and real-time processing capabilities to reduce bottlenecks.

### Throughput Requirements

The throughput requirements for the metaverse are significant, as they determine the ability of a network to handle a high volume of transactions and messages per second (TPS) (MPS). High transaction speed is crucial for a metaverse platform to function without compromising the user experience.&#x20;

A single virtual environment might need to process millions of micro-interactions—like avatar movements, object updates, or economic transactions—simultaneously. For context, modern blockchain networks like Ethereum handle about 15 TPS, while Visa peaks at around 24,000 TPS. The metaverse demands orders of magnitude beyond this, potentially reaching millions of TPS, to support seamless global participation.

### Scalability Needs

Scalability is another important requirement for the metaverse. As the demand for the network grows, a scalable network is necessary to manage the growing volume of users and transactions efficiently. Unlike traditional applications where user bases grow linearly, the metaverse could see exponential spikes due to viral events, such as virtual concerts or global gaming tournaments. A scalable system must dynamically allocate resources—think of it as elastic computing power—ensuring that a sudden influx of millions of users doesn’t crash the system or degrade performance for existing participants.

### Bandwidth Demands

The bandwidth required for the metaverse is also substantial, as it supports various activities such as,

* Live video streaming,
* Video conferencing,
* Live cloud gaming,
* Augmented and virtual reality applications,

For instance, a fully immersive metaverse experience may require at least 2.35 Gbps of bandwidth per user for high-fidelity visuals and interactions. This figure comes from estimates based on 8K resolution VR streaming at 120 frames per second, combined with spatial audio and real-time data overlays. Multiply this by millions of concurrent users, and the total bandwidth could rival the capacity of entire national internet grids. Current 5G networks, offering peak speeds of 1-10 Gbps, are a step forward, but widespread deployment and optimization remain critical hurdles.

### Cost Considerations

Cloud storage solutions for the metaverse can cost anywhere from $100,000 to $250,000, depending on the amount of data storage required. This estimate reflects petabyte-scale needs for storing 3D assets, user-generated content, and persistent world states. Additionally, the cost of data integration for metaverse applications can range from $12,000 to $40,000, covering middleware development and API synchronization across platforms. Beyond these, operational costs escalate with energy consumption—rendering a metaverse could demand data centers consuming megawatts of power, potentially pushing annual budgets into the tens of millions for large-scale providers.

### Summary of Metaverse Needs

In summary, the metaverse requires high throughput and bandwidth to ensure a seamless and scalable user experience, with current estimates suggesting "Significant Performance Advancements" in network infrastructure are needed to meet the demands that will come from "Millions Of Users" on a popular network. Beyond raw performance, security and privacy also loom large: a decentralized metaverse must protect against data breaches and ensure user trust, adding another layer of complexity to infrastructure design. Today’s internet, while robust, lacks the cohesion and capacity for such an ambitious leap.

### Quilibrium's Solution

Quilibrium uses a combination of advanced technologies; early tests have shown that it can handle 100M+ messages/sec and 1.5M transactions/sec with "Sub-Second Latency." These data will need to be confirmed once Quilibrium 2.1 is rolled out, but they are very promising so far.&#x20;

Its distributed computing network will enable applications to "Scale Globally" and handle the distributed nature of the metaverse. Data is spread across multiple servers or nodes, and it ensures that the virtual environment can handle an increasing number of users and interactions without compromising performance or user experience.&#x20;

Unlike centralized systems prone to single points of failure, Quilibrium’s architecture leverages a peer-to-peer model, reducing latency by processing data closer to users and enhancing resilience through redundancy. Additionally, its design supports cryptographic security, vital for protecting virtual economies and user identities. The platform’s ability to shard computations—dividing tasks across nodes—further boosts its capacity to manage the metaverse’s unpredictable workloads.

### Future Implications and Validation

Quilibrium’s potential extends beyond current benchmarks. As the metaverse evolves, integrating AI-driven NPCs, real-time physics simulations, and cross-platform interoperability, Quilibrium’s distributed framework could adapt to these demands without requiring a complete overhaul. The upcoming Quilibrium 2.1 release will be a critical milestone, offering real-world validation of its test results and providing developers with tools to build metaverse applications at scale.&#x20;
