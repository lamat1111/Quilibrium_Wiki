# Quilibrium: scalability for the metaverse without limitations

### Network Infrastructure Requirements

To support the metaverse, network infrastructure must be capable of handling high throughput, low latency, and high reliability. This includes the need for a significant increase in computational efficiency from today's standards.

### Throughput Requirements

The throughput requirements for the metaverse are significant, as they determine the ability of a network to handle a high volume of transactions and messages per second (TPS) (MPS). High transaction speed is crucial for a metaverse platform to function without compromising the user experience.

### Scalability Needs

Scalability is another important requirement for the metaverse. As the demand for the network grows, a scalable network is necessary to manage the growing volume of users and transactions efficiently.

### Bandwidth Demands

The bandwidth required for the metaverse is also substantial, as it supports various activities such as,

* Live video streaming,
* Video conferencing,
* Live cloud gaming,
* Augmented and virtual reality applications,

For instance, a fully immersive metaverse experience may require at least 2.35 Gbps of bandwidth.

### Cost Considerations

Cloud storage solutions for the metaverse can cost anywhere from $100,000 to $250,000, depending on the amount of data storage required. Additionally, the cost of data integration for metaverse applications can range from $12,000 to $40,000.

### Summary of Metaverse Needs

In summary, the metaverse requires high throughput and bandwidth to ensure a seamless and scalable user experience, with current estimates suggesting "Significant Performance Advancements" in network infrastructure are needed to meet the demands that will come from "Millions Of Users" on a popular network.

### Quilibrium's Solution

Quilibrium uses a combination of advanced technologies; early tests have shown that it can handle 100M+ messages/sec and 1.5M transactions/sec with "Sub-Second Latency." These data will need to be confirmed once Quilibrium 2.1 is rolled out, but they are very promising so far. Its distributed computing network will enable applications to "Scale Globally" and handle the distributed nature of the metaverse. Data is spread across multiple servers or nodes, and it ensures that the virtual environment can handle an increasing number of users and interactions without compromising performance or user experience.
