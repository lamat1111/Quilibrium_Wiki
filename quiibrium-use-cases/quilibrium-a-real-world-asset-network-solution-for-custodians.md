# Quilibrium: A Real World Asset Network Solution For Custodians

Custodians play a crucial role in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), ensuring the security and management of both digital and physical assets. They are essential in fostering investor confidence by safeguarding tokenized assets, which are digital representations of traditional assets like real estate, commodities, or financial instruments.

Custodians must consider various factors for the safeguarding of underlying assets they move on-chain, with the chosen network for storage and key management system used being a "Crucial" consideration for them.

### The "Privacy" of tokenized RWAs is another crucial concern for Custodians

They will often handle sensitive information on behalf of clients who will want their information to stay strictly confidential. Data (custody/privacy) laws can also be "Mandatory" for Custodians in some jurisdictions.

### What Will Custodians Look For In A Network?

The use of the most secure, advanced, and private hosting solution to prevent theft, fraud, or improper handling of tokenized RWAs moved on-chain.

This solution, when found, could become the most dominant network for RWA hosting in the industry. Custodians looking to foster "Client/Investor Confidence" in their custody services, stay compliant with regulations, and manage the risks associated with the tokenization and storage of billions of dollars of high-value assets will naturally be drawn to the best solution available to them.
