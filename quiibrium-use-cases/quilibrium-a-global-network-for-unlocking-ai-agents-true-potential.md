# Quilibrium: A Global Network For Unlocking AI Agents' True Potential

In the enterprise sector, a recent survey by Capgemini found that 82% of tech executives plan to integrate AI-based agents across their stacks within the next three years, with many trusting these agents to analyze and synthesize data.

AI agents face significant challenges to "Operate At Scale" and with "Data Integration," which is a critical hurdle for their "Adoption And Effectiveness."

According to recent reports, 80% of IT leaders cite data integration as the key challenge in "Deploying AI Agents" within their organizations. This issue arises because AI agents require "Seamless" access to structured and unstructured data across various systems. When data is not easily accessible, AI agents may not function optimally, leading to errors or incorrect outputs.

Integrating AI agents with pre-existing software, databases, and tools, especially legacy systems, presents technical roadblocks that can cause disruptions.

### Moving To A Better System To Overcome These Challenges

As AI agents become more prevalent, the demand for computational resources increases. "Millions" of agents will need the capacity of a network that is capable of sending and receiving potentially "Hundreds Of Millions" of messages simultaneously.

Another challenge is achieving true decentralization. A system used should not be controlled by a single entity or a small group. This requires the highest level of resilient infrastructure to distribute data across decentralized nodes, preventing single points of failure and ensuring reliable protection against hacks, outages, censorship, or data locking.

AI agent development requires careful planning and strategic approaches to overcome scalability and integration challenges. Ensuring seamless integration with existing systems and maintaining high-quality data and throughput speed is crucial for effective AI performance.

Quilibrium's fully decentralized MPC network has been designed and built to handle the massive "Parallel Processing" needs of hosting a global network of AI systems without "Performance Limitations Or Bottlenecks," unlocking the full potential of AI agents enhancing their ability to,

* Automate complex workflows,
* Store and share data,
* Improve decision-making,
* Enhance human productivity,
* Operate unhindered on a global network.
