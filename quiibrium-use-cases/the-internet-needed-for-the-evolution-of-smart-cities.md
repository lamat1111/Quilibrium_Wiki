# The Internet Needed for the Evolution of Smart Cities

Quilibrium's "Rapid Elastic Scaling network" system can automatically adjust resources based on demand, enabling efficient handling of traffic spikes and cost optimization.

The evolution of digital infrastructure in smart cities is an ongoing process, and it will continue to be driven by technology innovation. A fully decentralized system is needed to eliminate downtime and single points of failure.

A smart city works in real-time to improve the efficiency of urban services and enhance the quality of life for its residents. This includes the use of high-speed internet for its residents and the ability to manage various city systems such as:

* Transportation including autonomous connected vehicles
* Smart buildings
* Energy efficiency systems
* Environmental monitoring and public safety technology

### Examples

#### Smart Real-time Traffic Management

Analyzing traffic data to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve public transportation efficiency.

#### Smart Energy Management

Enhancing energy distribution and consumption through smart grids and IoT devices to improve sustainability and reduce costs.

#### Smart Buildings

Integrating IoT and smart technologies in buildings to optimize energy use, enhance security, and improve comfort for occupants.

#### Smart Parking

Implementing systems that use sensors and mobile apps to guide drivers to available parking spots, reducing traffic and emissions.

### Global Urbanization Growth

By 2030, experts estimate two-thirds of the worldâ€™s population will be living in cities, and the city populations of developing countries are also expected to double.

This rapid global urbanization will contribute to a sharp increase in the adoption of smart city technologies and internet usage. The infrastructure put in place for this will need the capacity of a robust, scalable network that is capable of continuously sending and receiving potentially hundreds of thousands of transactions simultaneously.

### Network Requirements for Smart Cities

A network of interconnected services operating in real-time will be essential for supporting smart city operations. As the network expands, this uncomplex, standardized, scalable infrastructure will handle the demands of advanced AI technologies, data-intensive applications, automation, and will also protect sensitive data from cyber risks, exposures, and unauthorized access.

#### Summary of Requirements

For ensuring that efficient and sustainable smart city operations can thrive in an unhindered environment, enabling easy and secure connections between services and providers and facilitating the frictionless onboarding of new services, a system needs to be:

* Standardized
* High-speed
* Secure
* Reliable
* Scalable
* Encrypted
* Decentralized

Quilibrium meets all these requirements.

### Quilibrium's Role

Its decentralized MPC network has been designed to handle the massive volume of data and transactions a smart city will generate with ease, and could effectively be used as the framework for securely hosting smart city technology and its internet in the future.

It's become clear that the current system used for the internet is at a breaking point. The complexity of all the connected systems used for its operation has become too vulnerable to allow it to scale any further.

With global web traffic and AI system use expected to significantly rise over the next decade, the situation is only going to get worse.

A new network designed to mitigate the problems of the current system is needed, and Quilibrium has been purposely designed for this.
