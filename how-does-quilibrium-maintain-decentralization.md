# How does Quilibrium maintain decentralization?

One of the biggest problems in **blockchain mining** is **centralization**—where a small number of **powerful miners** dominate the network and control most of the rewards. This happens in **Bitcoin** and other Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems because of how mining rewards are distributed.

Quilibrium **2.1** introduces a new model called **Proof of Meaningful Work (PoMW)** that **fundamentally changes how mining works**. Instead of allowing **a few large players to dominate**, it ensures that mining rewards are **fairly distributed among many participants**, keeping the network **decentralized, secure, and resistant to manipulation**.

***

### **The Problem: How Traditional PoW Leads to Centralization**

#### **How Bitcoin & Other PoW Networks Become Centralized**

* In **Bitcoin**, miners compete to solve **mathematical puzzles** to add blocks to the blockchain.
* The **first miner to solve the puzzle wins** and gets the entire reward.
* **Larger mining pools** (with more computing power) have a **higher chance of winning**, so:
  * **Small miners** almost **never win** and **join large mining pools** to get a share of rewards.
  * Over time, **a few mining pools control most of the network**.
  * Today, **the top 6 Bitcoin mining pools** control **over 80% of the network**, making it less decentralized.

#### **Why This is Dangerous**

* **51% Attack Risk** – If one or two mining pools control the majority of the network, they could **manipulate transactions** or **double-spend coins**.
* **Power Concentration** – A few large entities effectively **decide how the network operates**.
* **Hardware Barrier** – Small miners **can’t compete**, making mining **only profitable for big corporations**.

#### **Quilibrium’s Solution: Proof of Meaningful Work (PMW)**

Quilibrium **2.1** completely redesigns the mining system to prevent these issues. Instead of a **single winner-takes-all model**, it:

1. **Splits mining tasks into small, unique shards**
2. **Makes every miner do verifiable work**, preventing fake participation
3. **Incentivizes decentralization by preventing mining pool dominance**

***

## **How Quilibrium 2.1 Prevents Centralization**

### **Data Sharding – Distributing Mining Across the Network**

Quilibrium 2.1 introduces a **sharded mining structure**, where the network is broken into **millions of potential shards** (approximately 2.5 million at the transition phase). Instead of having all miners compete to process the same dataset, **data is distributed across multiple shards, each containing a portion of the network state**. Miners can choose which shards to work on, but each shard has its own **unique proof structure**, making it computationally expensive to dominate multiple shards at once.

Miners working within a shard must generate **specific cryptographic proofs** related to the data in that shard. The nature of these proofs ensures that simply increasing computational power does not guarantee dominance, as miners must **store and process verifiable data unique to each shard**. While miners are not strictly assigned to a single shard, **the cost and complexity of proving across multiple shards create a natural decentralization effect**.

**Why This Prevents Centralization:**

* **Large mining pools cannot dominate the network easily** because each shard requires **separate verifiable work**, making it inefficient for a single entity to take control.
* **Smaller miners remain competitive** since they are not forced to compete with the entire network, but rather work within **localized proof structures** that make it harder for large players to outscale them.
* **Sharded proofs and encryption mechanisms prevent miners from faking multiple identities**, ensuring that decentralization remains intact.

### **Difficulty Calibration – Adapting Mining Based on Hardware**

One issue with **Bitcoin** is that it only rewards those who have **the most powerful and expensive computers**.

In Quilibrium **2.1**, the **difficulty of mining adjusts based on the hardware used**. **Low-power miners (like Raspberry Pi devices) can still participate**, but they **work on smaller tasks**. High-power machines **are given more difficult tasks**, but **they don’t dominate all rewards**.

**Why This Prevents Centralization:**

* **People with basic computers can still mine**, making Quilibrium more accessible.
* No single **type of hardware gives an unfair advantage**, reducing the risk of centralization.

### **Adaptive Issuance Model – Preventing Long-Term Centralization**

A major issue in Bitcoin is that **mining rewards decrease over time**, making it increasingly difficult for new miners to participate. As mining becomes less profitable, **fewer people secure the network**, leading to centralization among the most powerful miners and a decline in security. This is known as Bitcoin’s **"shrinking security budget"** problem, where **fewer miners means a weaker, more vulnerable network**​.

Quilibrium 2.1 solves this issue with a **dynamic issuance model** that adapts based on real-time network conditions. Instead of simply halving rewards like Bitcoin, Quilibrium **tracks computational power growth using Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs)**. These functions measure how fast the network processes data, allowing Quilibrium to **adjust mining rewards at specific growth milestones** rather than at rigid time intervals​.

Every time the network reaches a **new computational threshold** (e.g., when the number of verified computations reaches 100 million iterations), Quilibrium **unlocks a new generation of token issuance**. This ensures that mining **remains profitable even as computing power evolves**, keeping participation strong and preventing centralization​.

#### **How This Prevents Centralization**

* **Mining incentives remain strong over time**, preventing a collapse in miner participation.
* **New miners can still enter the system**, unlike in Bitcoin, where later miners face diminishing returns.
* **The network adjusts dynamically**, meaning rewards don’t favor early adopters disproportionately.

By making token issuance **responsive to real-world computing power** rather than a **fixed halving schedule**, Quilibrium ensures **a long-term sustainable mining ecosystem** that **stays decentralized and secure**.

By combining **data sharding, unique proofs, verifiable encryption, adaptive rewards, and difficulty calibration**, Quilibrium **ensures true decentralization**, making it **impossible for a few big players to take over the network**.&#x20;
