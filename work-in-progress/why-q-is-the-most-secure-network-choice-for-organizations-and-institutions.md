# Why Q is the most secure network choice for organizations and institutions?

Cybercrime is growing exponentially: The cost and rate of cybercrime has increased dramatically over the past few decades.

Current Systems Suffer From Complex Architecture This Complexity Creates A Weak System More Prone To Data Breachs.

The Risk From Complex Systems:

Increased attack surface: More complex systems often have a larger "attack surface," meaning more potential points of entry for hackers to target. Patching difficulties:

Harder to monitor: With many interconnected components, effectively monitoring and managing security across the entire system becomes challenging, allowing issues to slip through unnoticed.

Patching difficulties: Keeping all parts of a complex system updated with the latest security patches can be difficult, leaving vulnerabilities open for exploitation.

Poor visibility: The sheer complexity can make it hard to understand how different parts of the system interact, hindering the ability to identify security gaps.

Multiple legacy systems: Integrating outdated systems with newer technology can create a complex network with inconsistent security protocols, making it easier to breach.

Overlapping security tools: Using too many different security products from various vendors can lead to complex configurations and potential conflicts, reducing overall effectiveness.

How to mitigate complexity-related data breach risks:

Streamline The System Architecture: Simplify network design and reduce the number of unnecessary components where possible.

Encryption: Encrypt all electronic information using industry-standard encryption methods. This includes data at rest and data in motion. Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the proper decryption key.

Decentralize On A Private MPC Network: Decentralized private networks using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) are designed to enhance security and privacy in data management by distributing data on private Shards across multiple nodes.

Designed To Host A Complex Global Internet Infrastructure: Quilibriums "Uncomplex" Fluid design is the solution A Decentralised Cryptographicaly Secure And Private Sharded Network Built To withstand the constantly evolving threats and vulnerabilities from cybercrime.
