# Hosting ERP Systems on the Quilibrium Network

According to recent statistics, approximately 88% of global organizations use some type of ERP tool to help in their business operations on a day-to-day basis.\
Additionally, more than 70% of large enterprises use ERP software, indicating widespread adoption across various industries.

ERP systems are business management software suites used by companies that integrate and manage various business processes in real-time.\
They have evolved over the years, and many are now typically web-based applications that users can access remotely, offering flexibility and scalability.

The interconnected nature of ERP systems exposes them to a significant risk of data breaches and cybercrime.\
Rising numbers of ransomware attacks continue to pose a serious threat to organizations, with more advanced attack methods forcing ransomware payouts.\
Finding a secure solution is one of the key issues faced by companies in today's cybercrime-accelerated world.

### Protecting Systems

A data breach can lead to widespread data loss and compliance risks. Lost data could include sensitive financial information and corporate secrets.\
Businesses can also suffer fines, financial loss, and reputational damage, which is often irreparable.\
Because of this, companies will take every possible measure to reduce risk and limit liability to protect themselves from substantial fines that could potentially lead them to bankruptcy.

### Reducing Complexity

Current integrated network software solutions used to host ERP systems combine complex technology layers from centralized third-party suppliers for security, storage, etc., and costs can vary depending on each provider.\
Integrated network systems can conflict due to different programming languages, firewall configurations, etc., and the layers of combined software have a larger attack surface area. The inherent gaps in the connected software make them more susceptible to hacking.

### Quilibrium’s Standardized System Could Be Used to Keep ERP Systems and Company Data Secure

Quilibrium’s use can play a critical role in securing data both in transit and at rest, ensuring it remains protected from cybercriminals.\
ERP systems could operate from a hub hosted on the Quilibrium network, and its use could mitigate the potential of exploits against ever-more sophisticated cyberattacks involving malware, phishing, and artificial intelligence.\
Hosting on Quilibrium’s network will lower or remove most maintenance tasks and costs associated with using an integrated network.

Quilibrium offers a cost-effective, streamlined, cryptographically secure solution for ERP system hosting and data storage and can provide 24-hour safe access to data for both in-house staff and remote workers.

This is a real-world use case for Quilibrium and illustrates the potential benefits of using its network.
