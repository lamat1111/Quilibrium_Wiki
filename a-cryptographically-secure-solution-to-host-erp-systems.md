# A Cryptographically Secure Solution to Host ERP Systems

ERP systems are business management software suites that integrate and manage various business processes in real-time, often using a single database.

The interconnected nature of ERP systems makes them significantly vulnerable to data breaches. Cybercrime and ransomware attacks continue to pose a serious threat to organizations, with more advanced attack methods forcing ransomware payouts. Finding a secure solution is one of the key issues faced by companies in today's cybercrime-accelerated world.

### Protecting Systems

A data breach can lead to widespread data loss and compliance risks. Lost data could include sensitive financial information or corporate secrets. Businesses can also suffer fines, financial loss, and reputational damage, which is often irreparable. Because of this, companies take every possible measure to reduce risk, limit liability, and protect themselves from substantial fines that could potentially lead to bankruptcy.

### Reducing Complexity

Current integrated solutions for hosting ERP systems often combine complex layers of software technology from separate suppliers for security, storage, etc., and costs can vary depending on each provider. Because of this, integrated systems have a larger attack surface area, and the inherent gaps in the connected software make them more susceptible to hacking.

### Quilibrium Offers a Safer, Comprehensive Solution to Minimize Risk

Using Quilibrium can play a critical role in securing data both in transit and at rest, ensuring it remains protected from cybercriminals. Quilibrium’s enhanced privacy network can be used to host a hub for embedded ERP systems and mitigate the risk of sophisticated cyberattacks involving malware, phishing, and artificial intelligence. Using Quilibrium’s network requires less maintenance and technical support than an integrated network.

Quilibrium could be a more cost-effective and secure solution for organizations worldwide to use for their data storage requirements and for hosting ERP systems.

This is a real-world use case where Quilibrium could be applied, illustrating its potential compared to the thousands of projects that lack any real-world utility.
