# Q Story and Roadmap

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Q building 2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### 🌱 Birth

📅 2018 \
Quilibrium is beginning to take shape in Cassie's mind… while she works on different components of the network, with the idea of creating a private and safe Discord alternative called "Howler".

### 💀 Internet declared "dead"

📅 August 2021 \
Cassie's public declaration to pivot towards a fully decentralized direction. Realization that centralized powers exert too much control over user freedom, necessitating a solution beyond just a Discord alternative.

### 🔄 Redesign Phase

📅 2019 - 2022 \
Intense period of redesigning the network. Evolved from a blockchain-like structure to a novel design separating data clocks from the master clock, solving sharding coordination problems and improving throughput.

### 🎭 The Ceremony

📅 April 2023 - March 2023 \
Launch of a global entropy gathering event to ensure network proof security. Designed for worldwide participation on various devices, garnering contributions from nearly all non-embargoed countries. Q had roughly double the ceremony contributions than Ethereum had to theirs.

### 🌅 Dawn

📅 September 2023 - February 2024 \
Pushing Quilibrium to its limits, stress-testing everything from BFT consensus to multi-platform compatibility. A journey of constant rewrites and improvements.

### 🌆 Dusk

📅 March 2024 - October 2024\
Gradual roll out and testing of the components required for mainnet: Autoscaling, Hypergraph, Onion Routing and Mixnet. This phase contains the updates: Sunset > Nightfall > Midnight (mainnet)

### 🌉 Ethereum bridge

📅 May 13, 2024 \
Rolling out the Ethereum bridge first version, to allow early node runners to claim their hard-earned tokens as wrapped $QUIL ($wQUIL).

### 🌃 Midnight (v2.1 - mainnet)

📅 Q1 2025\
Final phase of "Dusk": entering full stealth mode. Now node runners can mint and transfer the QUIL token, and builders can create and launch apps on Quilibrium.

### ☯️ Equinox

📅 ETA: TBD \
Laying the groundwork for serious applications. Think S3-compatible storage, Redis-like databases, and more. Building a Swiss Army knife for decentralized services.

### 🌌 Event Horizon

📅 ETA: TBD \
Things get truly advanced. End-to-end encrypted streaming, AI model training, and execution. Essentially building the operating system for a decentralized future.
