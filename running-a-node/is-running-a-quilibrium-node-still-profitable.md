# Is running a Quilibrium node still profitable?

{% hint style="info" %}

It can be, especially if you're looking at a 6-12 month window. If you're aiming to make significant money within a month, it's probably not the best option. Running a node isn't simple at the moment because the protocol is still in its early stages, which means there may be bugs and obstacles, and competition among node operators is growing.

If you plan on renting a server to run a node, make sure to get a high-quality machine (not a cheap VPS) and have a financial buffer to cover the cost for at least 3 months before evaluating your situation. Additionally, be prepared to invest time in learning how to manage your node, keep it updated, and address any issues promptly.

On the other hand, if you have a spare machine at home and your electricity costs aren't high, thatâ€™s likely the best scenario to pursue, regardless of whether your node is immediately profitable.

Finally, if you believe that $QUIL can reach at least $2 this market cycle (\~ 1.5 to 1.8 billion market cap), then the specifics become less critical. The current cost to mine each QUIL for a fresh node (as of 22.08.2024) is between $0.15 and $0.30, depending on your server costs and specifications.\
\
Keep in mind that node uptime is crucial in Quilibrium to earn more rewards over time. So you need both a node with good specs and to keep it online as much as possible to avoid loosing your prover ring spot (see: [how-does-quilibrium-reward-the-most-efficient-nodes.md](how-does-quilibrium-reward-the-most-efficient-nodes.md "mention")).\
\
Node runners that have been mining for 2 or 3 months with fast machines have a cost per QUIL as low as $0.05 to $0.10 now.
