# Is running a Quilibrium node still profitable?

{% hint style="info" %}
This articles refers to 27.11.2024
{% endhint %}

**Right at this moment, it is not profitable to run Q nodes for most node runners.**&#x20;

This is due to several factors: \
Q price being oversold, rewards being dramatically reduced in v2.0, the new "prover ring" system, bugs causing the proof landing rate to be reduced, and increased competition due to big miners joining the project.&#x20;

Things could shift again in 2.1 as the prover ring system will change, with many more rings being available and a more complex rewards system. Hopefully, most bugs will be resolved too. If you are thinking about starting a node right now, you should expect the node to mine at a loss for a few months.\
\
If you plan on renting a server to run a node, make sure to get a high-quality machine (not a cheap VPS) and have a financial buffer to cover the cost for at least 3 months before evaluating your situation. Additionally, be prepared to invest time in learning how to manage your node, keep it updated, and address any issues promptly.\
\
On the other hand, if you have a spare machine at home and your electricity costs aren't high, thatâ€™s likely the best scenario to pursue, regardless of whether your node is immediately profitable.\
\
Keep in mind that node uptime is crucial in Quilibrium to earn more rewards over time. So you need both a node with good specs and to keep it online as much as possible to avoid loosing your prover ring spot (see: [how-does-quilibrium-reward-the-most-efficient-nodes.md](how-does-quilibrium-reward-the-most-efficient-nodes.md "mention")).

If you are interested in learning more about running nodes, see the:
