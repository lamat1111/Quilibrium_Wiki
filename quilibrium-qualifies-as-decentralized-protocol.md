# Quilibrium qualifies as "decentralized protocol"

Quilibrium qualifies as a decentralized protocol under US law, and its token is considered a commodity.

The QUIL token qualifies as a commodity. Q Inc, an American company, owns less than 1% of the token (much less, in fact).

FIT21, the new US-approved regulatory framework on crypto, has specific requirements regarding what qualifies as a decentralized protocol. These requirements focus on token holdings of developers, accessibility of source code, and release management/adoption. Quilibrium already meets these requirements, albeit loosely, as we progress towards version 2.0. By 2.0, there will be no question about compliance.

This means our fair launch model is coincidentally the first that truly went straight to launch in the "right" way, excluding Bitcoin, which we aimed to emulate with ethical launches.
