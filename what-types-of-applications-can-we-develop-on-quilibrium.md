# What types of applications can we develop on Quilibrium?

_By:_ [_Cassandra Heart_](https://warpcast.com/cassie) _- Source:_ [_Q Forum_](https://quilibrium.discourse.group/t/are-we-ready-to-build-on-quilibrium/76/2)

***

The ultimate end state is to be a platform in which any application can be built, but the first generation of applications will fall into a few common categories:

* Social Media:
  * Image hosting
  * Long-form content
  * Social graphs
* Financial:
  * Tokenized assets
  * DeFi
* Common Web Dev:
  * SPAs
  * File hosting

**What software knowledge will be required for applications to be developed on Quilibrium? (GO, javascript, rust, html, css etc?)**

For network native development, QCL, as a subset of golang, is the primary language. Building new intrinsics can be done in many different languages, ideally golang, rust, or C++.

**Can classic blockchain applications that will make the ecosystem financially dynamic - such as tokens, NFTs, DEXs, DeFi applications etc. be developed?**

Yes

**Will we have various toolkits like SDKs to be able to develop?**

Yes, local simulator and SDKs are coming up shortly.

**Will incentive rewards for developers be on the agenda?**

In tokens: Difficult question to answer without greater regulatory clarity, at least for Q Inc.\
In cash: If Q Inc becomes in a financial position to be able to, otherwise the biggest thing we intend to do is provide a free tier for managed services on Q Console.

**What could be the priority areas for development on Q?**

* Protocol:
  * New intrinsics to support additional applications beyond building on direct garbled circuits or ZKPs
  * Moving more things into Rust
* Standards:
  * Defining interaction standards for certain types of applications
